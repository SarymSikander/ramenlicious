                        Anyone from Japan can tell you: the two key ingredients in ramen are the broth and the noodles.

                    <p>
                        That’s why at ramenlicious, we work hard to ensure they both take center stage. 
                        Slowly simmered for more than twenty hours, each of our six signature broths balances flavors from whole pork bones, 
                        chicken and vegetables with just the right amount of bonito, dashi, miso, kombu, and other classic Japanese ingredients. 
                        The result is a rich broth that is thick, full-flavored, and unforgettable.

                                we create the best texture and flavour in our noodles that will highly complement our signature soup base.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The genesis of the restaurant was our vision to bring delicious, real ramen to college students and college towns. 
                        The name tries to capture that inspiration. The character “学” can be generally translated as “learning” or “education” 
                        or “study,” and is often read as “gaku” (in Japanese, the same character may be read different ways depending on how it 
                        is used and whether and how it is combined with other characters). As a verb, it means “to learn or study” (学ぶ, manabu). 
                        But it is also combined with other characters to create the words “student” (学生, gakusei) and ”college” (大学, daigaku). 
                        Of course, everyone is welcome at Gaku Ramen. But Gaku Ramen is for amazing towns and cities that draw on college and university 
                        students for their character, energy and vibrancy. Burlington and Boulder are emblematic of this ethos.

                    Gaku Ramen (学ラーメン) was conceived of by three friends (Ryan Goldstein, Michael March and David Stone) who wanted to combine their
                    passion for ramen with their love of friendly college towns. Ryan and David are Dartmouth graduates (class of ’93), who were friends 
                    from their first day on campus. Michael is a Middlebury graduate (class of ‘77), and he and Ryan have been friends for years as well.

                        Ryan has studied Japanese and Japanese history for over 20 years, and currently lives in Tokyo. 
                        He Is also an owner of the highly-praised Q Sushi in Los Angeles. Michael has studied Japanese 
                        and Chinese and has lived in various cities in his more than 30 years in Asia. David is a surgeon 
                        at Dartmouth, and lives in Vermont.

                        <br>
                         Ryan and Michael were both living in Tokyo and often thought about how great it would have been to
                         have had a real ramen restaurant where they went to college. They talked for years about opening 
                         such restaurants in vibrant college towns like the ones they lived in accessible to the college 
                         students they thought would enjoy real ramen. But it was mostly just talk.
